Script to do daily searches on Microsoft edge for Microsoft Reward points

## Info
Create this script to run searches for Microsoft Rewards. Currently a user has to do a search every 5 seconds and that is time consuming. This script aims to save the time that goes into manually searching by automating it. It uses python and selenium to read from a file and search each term in it.
